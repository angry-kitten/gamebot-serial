Not yet functional.

This is a JoyCon emulator that connects to the console via USB and is controlled via a serial cable. This is a part of the gamebot project, but should be useful for other things stand-alone.

Current development is with the Teensy 2.0++.

A python module is included for sending commands over the serial to the microcontroller. 
See the gamebot project for more info.
